/*You will be given an array of positive integers. Your task is to count how many of them are Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Here are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Input
You will be given a positive integer k (where 1 <= k <= 100 ) indicating the number of integers in the set, followed by k positive integers separated by whitespace. The input integers will be between 1 and 109.

Output

Output the number of integers in the set that are Fibonacci numbers.
